## Next Steps

While this document outlines comprehensive improvements across all areas, initial implementation will focus on:

1. **Documentation and Error Handling**: Addressing the most immediate needs for consistency and reliability
2. **Resource Management**: Ensuring proper handling of GPU resources for both cloud and local providers
3. **Benchmark System**: Building a robust evaluation framework specific to text capabilities
4. **Analytics Integration**: Connecting text models to the existing analytics framework

Security and compliance (Section 12 of the audit) should be addressed as a separate initiative following these enhancements.
