## Next Steps

While we've addressed most of the audit checklist requirements, the following items could still be improved:

1. **User Interface Integration**: The current implementations provide API endpoints and data structures for UI integration, but a dedicated frontend for monitoring and alerting would enhance usability.

2. **Comprehensive Provider-Specific Tests**: While we've added general test infrastructure, each provider could benefit from specific tests tailored to their unique characteristics.

3. **Full Security Audit**: Security-focused testing and documentation (Section 12 of the audit) has not been implemented as requested.
